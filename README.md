# CS5890-Project

## Project Structure
We used Reactjs to build the visualizations in combination with d3. The `app` directory
contains all of the javascript an html. The actual visualation react components are located in `app/client/apps/hello_world/components`.

In the root there is also a `java` folder which contains all of the scripts used to process data.

The data is located in `app/client/apps/hello_world/data` and there is a lot of it.
